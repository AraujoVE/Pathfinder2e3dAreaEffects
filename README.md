# Pathfinder2e3dAreaEffects
The range3d.py is used to create the csv files containing all the 3d area representations.
The createAreaImages.py creates the images based on the csv files.
The cropImages.py crops all the png borders.
The csv files are inside the areas3d and the images are inside imagesToCrop/images

The 3d areas used are emanation - that can be also used to determine ranged spells reach in 3d environments -, Bursts, Air Walk movement - the movement restrictions were taken into account -, Fly Up movement - the difficult terrain was taken into account - and Fly Down movement - the incresed movement when descending was taken into account.
